# Assignment Details

You are to create a website for one of the concerts/festivals taking place in Ireland this Summer. You are to create two versions of the website:

- Version One: Implement the website using Positioning (absolute, relative, floats, etc).
- Version One: Implement the website using Semantic UI.

**Note:** You can use the same content for both versions of the website.


## Part A: HTML5 layout

- The website should make use of:
  - Layout using HTML5 semantic structural elements (i.e. nav, header, footer, etc.)
  - CSS layout properties (e.g. position, float)
  - Background images
  - Figures and figcaptions
- You should also include a mix of other content we have covered this semester (e.g. images, paragraphs, headings, links, lists, tables) and apply CSS styles to this content
- All CSS should be contained in an external stylesheet
- The website should consist of 4-5 pages
- Your website should include a nav section with links to all pages in the website
- The website must be hosted on a web server of your choice (e.g. 000webhost)
- Make sure your files validate at:
  - <a href="http://validator.w3.org" target="_ blank">`http://validator.w3.org`</a> (for HTML)
  - <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator" target="_ blank">`http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator`</a> (for CSS)


## Part B: Semantic UI layout

- The Semantic UI website should make use of:
  - Layout using the Semantic UI grid
  - Semantic UI navigation menu
  - At least one form
  - Some other Semantic UI component that we have not covered in class â€“ have a look at the Semantic UI website for some ideas::
    - <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/" target="_ blank">`https://semantic-ui.com/`</a>
- The website must be hosted on a web server of your choice (e.g. 000webhost)
