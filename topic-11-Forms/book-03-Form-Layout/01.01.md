# Basic Form

Firstly, add the `form` class to the &lt;form&gt; tag. 

Then, enclose each combined/related label and text input with an element (such as a &lt;div&gt;) with the `field` class.

<a href="archives/Class Htmls/ex1.html" target = "_blank">Basic Form example</a>

<form action="" method = "get" class="ui form">
  <div class="field">
    <label for = "name" >Name</label>
    <input type="text" id = "name" name = "name" autofocus>
  </div>
  <input type ="submit" class="ui submit button" value = "Submit">
</form>
~~~

Note that the label is transformed to uppercase. This was done through CSS as follows:

~~~
.ui.form .field > label {
   text-transform: uppercase;
}
