# Radio buttons and Textarea elements


## Radio buttons

To style a radio button on a form, combine  the `radio` class with the `checkbox` class as in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/ex11.html" target = "_blank">example</a>.

~~~
<form action="" method = "get" class="ui form">
  ...
  <div class="grouped fields">
      <label for="fruit">Select your favourite fruit:</label>
      <div class="field">
        <div class="ui radio checkbox">
          <input type="radio" name="fruit" checked="checked" id = "apple" value = "apple">
          <label for = "apple" >Apples</label>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="field">
        <div class="ui radio checkbox">
          <input type="radio" name="fruit"  id = "orange" value = "orange">
          <label for = "orange">Oranges</label>
        </div>
      </div>
      ...
    </div>
  <button class="ui button" type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
~~~

Note that using the `grouped` class with the `fields` class means that the child elements are related to each other and are output with a reduced margin between them.


### Textarea

You just enclose the textarea inside an element (such as a &lt;div&gt;) with the class `field` as in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/ex12.html" target = "_blank">example</a>.

~~~
<div class="field">
  <label for = "comments">Comments</label>
  <textarea id = "comments" name = "comments"></textarea>
</div>
~~~

Finally, take a look at the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/ex13.html" target = "_blank">example</a>, which includes a form with many elements. The example also
includes a `header` class combined with the `dividing` class. This outputs a header with a line underneath.
