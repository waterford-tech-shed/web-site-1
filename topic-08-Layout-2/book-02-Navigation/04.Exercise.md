Download [lab05.rar](archives/lab05.rar) and extract it into your Week 8 folder. (Again, don't continue with the same website files that you worked on earlier; the aim is to create a different layout for the Tresidder site, starting from scratch.)

The four different colours for the link items are red; #3333CC; green; and purple. (Hint: you can use classes to style each item differently.)
