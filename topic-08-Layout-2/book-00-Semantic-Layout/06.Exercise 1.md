## Exercise One: WIT Website

In this practical we will add and style Structural Elements to enhance the look of our WIT website to look as follows:

![](./img/ex1.png)

Create a folder called Week 8. Download [lab01.zip](archives/lab01.zip) and extract it into the Week 8 folder.

### Modify the .html files as follows:

  - After the opening `<body>` tag add a div called container (i.e. `<div id = "container">`).
  - Within the container div, add a header element. The opening header tag should be before the opening `<h1>` tag and the closing header tag should be after the closing `</h1>` tag.
  - Add `<nav>` tags around the `<ul>` (the unordered list contains a list of links which are the navigation for the site.)
  - After the closing `</nav>` tag, put a `<main>` tag. The main element should surround the rest of the content on the page (the h2 heading and two paragraphs).
  - At the end of the page (before the closing `<body>` tag) including the closing tags for the  main element,  and the container div (i.e.`</main></div>`)
  - You will need to add these structural tags to all three of the HTML pages in the site: index.html, director.html and aboutwit.html.
  - The finished HTML code should look like this:
  
  <img src = "./img/code2.PNG" width = "600" height="300">

### Add styles to the .css file

  - Add a background-color of #050845 to the body element in the CSS file.
  - Add the following styles to the container div.
    - background-color: #fdf8f2
    - margin: 3%
    - padding: 1%
    - overflow: auto
  - Add a background colour of #256290 to the nav and header.
  - Add padding of 2em to the header, and a bottom margin of 0.5em.
  - Find the h1, a:link, and a:visited selectors in the css file and change the font colour property of each one to white.
  - The nav structural element should be 13em wide and floated to the left.
  - The main structural element should be moved in from the left by 14em using the margin-left property.
