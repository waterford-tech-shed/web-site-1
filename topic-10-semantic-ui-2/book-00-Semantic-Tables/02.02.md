# Adding Colour


##Striped

We can add stripes to our tables by adding a class `.striped`. This applies style (and colour) to every second row of the table 
as in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/tables/table9.html" target = "_ blank">example</a>.
~~~
<table class="ui striped table">
~~~

##Selectable

We can add a class (`.selectable`) to a table to mimic the *hover* action as in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/tables/table10.html" target = "_ blank">example</a>.

~~~
<table class="ui selectable table">
~~~

## Modifying Semantic UI Classes

To change the colour used in the previous example, we need to modify a few classes.

~~~
    .ui.table thead th{
      background: pink;
      color: white;
    }
    
    .ui.striped.table > tr:nth-child(2n),
    .ui.striped.table tbody tr:nth-child(2n) {
      background-color: rgba(219,112,147, .3);
    }

    .ui.selectable.table tbody tr:hover,
    .ui.table tbody tr td.selectable:hover {
      background-color: rgba(158, 76, 76,.5) !important;
    }
~~~

- The first style rule is for the table heading &lt;th&gt;s inside the &lt;thead&gt;, here we modify the background-color and color properties.
- The second style rule is for tables that have the `.striped` class, here we modify the background-color property.
- The third style rule is for tables that have the `.selectable` class, here we modify the background-color property.

*Note:* The `!important` rule is a way to make your CSS cascade but also have the rules you feel are most crucial always be applied. 
A rule that has the `!important` property will always be applied no matter where that rule appears in the CSS document.

<a href="archives/Class Htmls/tables/table11.html" target = "_ blank">Example</a>.

##Colour

A table can be given a colour to distinguish it from other tables. The following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/tables/table12.html" target = "_ blank">example</a>
has 3 tables, each with a different colour.

~~~
<table class="ui red table">
~~~


## Inverted

A table's colours can be inverted as in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/tables/table13.html" target = "_ blank">example</a>.

~~~
<table class="ui inverted red table">
~~~

## Aligned

A table header, row, or cell can adjust its text alignment its vertical alignment as in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/tables/table14.html" target = "_ blank">example</a>.

~~~
<table class= "ui table">
  <thead>
   <tr><th>Name</th>
    <th class = "right aligned">Age</th>
    <th>Job</th>
    <th>Other Info</th>
   </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class = "top aligned">James</td>
      <td class = "top aligned right aligned">24</td>
      <td class = "top aligned">Engineer</td>
      <td>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit....</td>
    </tr>
    ...
  </tbody>
</table>
