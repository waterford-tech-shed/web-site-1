# Simple Tables

The `.ui.table` class added to the &lt;table&gt; tag renders a standard table.

~~~
<div class = "ui container">
<table class="ui table">
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Name</th>
    <th>Age</th>
    <th>Job</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>James</td>
      <td>24</td>
      <td>Engineer</td>
    </tr>
   ...
</table>
</div>
~~~

The table rendered has a background colour on the &lt;th&gt; tags inside the &lt;thead&gt; tag.

<a href="archives/Class Htmls/tables/table1.html" target = "_ blank">Example</a>.

##Celled

To add borders around the cells (&lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt;), we can add the `.celled` class as in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/tables/table1a.html" target = "_ blank">example</a>.
~~~
<table class="ui celled table">
~~~

##Basic

To remove the colour from the table head, we can add the `.basic` class as in the 
following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/tables/table2.html" target = "_ blank">example</a>.
~~~
<table class="ui basic table">
~~~

##Padded

To add some padding to the cells, we can add the `.padded` class as in the 
following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/tables/table3.html" target = "_ blank">example</a>.
~~~
<table class="ui padded table">
~~~

##Compact

A table may sometimes need to be more compact to make more rows visible at a time. We can add the `.compact` class as in the 
following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/tables/table4.html" target = "_ blank">example</a>.
~~~
<table class="ui compact table">
~~~

##Fixed

A table can use a special faster form of table rendering that does not resize table cells based on content. We can add the `.fixed` class as in the 
following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/tables/table5.html" target = "_ blank">example</a>.
~~~
<table class="ui fixed table">
~~~

##Collapsing

A table can be collapsing, taking up only as much space as its rows. We can add the `.collapsing` class as in the 
following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/tables/table6.html" target = "_ blank">example</a>.
~~~
<table class="ui collapsing table">
~~~

##Single Line

A table can specify that its cell contents should remain on a single line, and not wrap. We can add the `.single line` class as in the 
following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/tables/table7.html" target = "_ blank">example</a>.
~~~
<table class="ui single line table">
~~~

**Note:** The following CSS style rule is added to allow us to read the entire row (if some content is not visible).

~~~
.ui.container {
   overflow:scroll;
}
~~~

##Column Width

A table can specify the width of individual columns independently as in the 
following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/tables/table8.html" target = "_ blank">example</a>.
~~~
  <thead>
    <tr>
     <th class="eight wide">Name</th>
     <th class="four wide">Age</th>
     <th class="four wide">Job</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
~~~
