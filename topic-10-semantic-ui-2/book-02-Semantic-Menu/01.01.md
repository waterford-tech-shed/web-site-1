# Menus

## Simple Menu

A simple menu can be created using the `.ui.menu` class. And you may specify how many items are in the menu. For each menu item you add the `.item` class, and
for the current (active) item, add the `.active` class.

~~~
<div class="ui three item menu">
  <a class="active item" href = "index.html">WIT Home Page</a>
  <a class="item" href = "aboutwit.html">About WIT</a>
  <a class="item" href = "director.html">Director's Welcome</a>
</div>
~~~

<a href="archives/Class Htmls/menus/menu/index.html" target="_blank">Example</a>.

## Vertical Menu

Menu items can be displayed vertically (instead of horizontally).

~~~
<div class="ui vertical menu">
  <a class="active red item">
    Inbox
    <div class="ui red left pointing label">1</div>
  </a>
  <a class="item">
    Spam
    <div class="ui label">51</div>
  </a>
  <a class="item">
    Deleted
    <div class="ui label">1</div>
  </a>
</div>

## Pointing

A menu can point to show its relationship to nearby content.

~~~
<div class="ui pointing menu">
  <a class="active item" href= "index.html">Home</a>
  <a class="item" href= "aboutwit.html">About WIT  </a>
  <a class="item" href= "director.html">Director</a>
</div>
<div class="ui segment">
  <h2>WIT Home Page</h2>
  <p>Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT) is a university-level institution in the South-East
  of Ireland with over 10,000 students and 1000 staff. </p>
  <p>WIT offers tuition and research programs in various areas up to PhD level.</p>
</div>
</div>

Some classes are copied (from semantic.css) into our .CSS file and modified as necessary.

Here we make the following changes:

- The font family is changed for the menu items,  the colour is changed to black, and they are bolded.
- The background colour for the pointing element is changed to #9FB6CD.
- When a menu item is hovered over, the background colour and colour are changed to #9FB6CD and white respectively. 
- The background colour and colour are changed also for the active menu item. The font weight property is set to bold.

~~~
.ui.pointing.menu .item {
  font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  color: black;
  font-weight:bold;
}

.ui.pointing.menu .active.item:after {
  background-color: #256290;
}

/* Hover */

.ui.pointing.menu .item:hover {
  background-color:#9FB6CD;
  color:white;
}

/* Active */

.ui.pointing.menu .active.item {
  background-color:#256290;
  color:white;
  font-weight:bold;
}
