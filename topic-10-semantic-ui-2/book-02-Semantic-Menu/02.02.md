# Tabular Menu

A tabular(tabbed effect) menu can be added by using the `.ui.tabular.menu` class. A tab is a hidden section of content activated by a menu, and will only become visible 
when given the class name `.active`.

~~~
<div class="ui top attached tabular menu">
 <a class="active item" data-tab="index">WIT Home Page</a>
 <a class="item" data-tab="aboutwit">About WIT</a>
 <a class="item" data-tab="director">Director's Welcome</a>
</div>
<div class="ui bottom attached tab item active segment" data-tab="index">
 <h2>WIT Home Page</h2>
 <p>Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT) is a university-level institution in the South-East
  of Ireland with over 10,000 students and 1000 staff. </p>
 <p>WIT offers tuition and research programs in various areas up to PhD level.</p>

<div class="ui bottom attached tab item segment" data-tab="aboutwit">
 <h2>About WIT </h2>
 <p>Waterford Institute of Technology is one of the largest institutes of technology in Ireland. 
 It was established as a Regional Technical College in 1970, and was the first to be awarded Institute of Technology status in 1998. 
 Over the period of this process, and as a result of an international quality review, the Institute was granted delegated authority by the 
 National Council for Educational Awards to confer its own Certificates and Diplomas.

In the above example, because all the sites information is in the one file, we target each **tab item** using the `data-tab` attribute.

## Separating the tab information into separate files

Rather than having one large file, we can move the tab information into different files as in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/menus/tab1/index.html" target="_blank">example</a>.
~~~
<div class="ui top attached tabular menu">
 <a class="active item" href = "index.html">WIT Home Page</a>
 <a class="item" href = "aboutwit.html">About WIT</a>
 <a class="item" href = "director.html">Director's Welcome</a>
</div>
<div class="ui bottom attached tab item active">
 <h2>WIT Home Page</h2>
 <p>Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT) is a university-level institution in the South-East
    of Ireland with over 10,000 students and 1000 staff. </p>
 <p>WIT offers tuition and research programs in various areas up to PhD level.</p>
</div>

## Adding Style

The above example can be modified by adding some of the style rules from the semantic.css file into your own .css file. You can then modify the property values.
Here we make the following changes:

- A bottom margin is added to the menu to provide more whitespace before the content. 
- The font family is changed for the menu items,  the colour is changed to black, and they are bolded.
- When a menu item is hovered over, the background colour and colour are changed to #9FB6CD and white respectively. 
The border radius is also set and a border colour (same as background colour) is set.
- The background colour and colour are changed also for the active menu item. Again the border colour (same as background colour) is set.
