 <h3>Range and Scope</h3>
<p>WIT is the major provider of higher education in the South East region of Ireland and one of the largest IOT's in Ireland. The Institute's range and scope reflect the changing needs of the southeast as well as the country as a whole.
</p>
<p>
The range of academic programmes is exceptionally extensive, ranging from Higher Certificate right through to post-doctoral research and covering the Humanities, Health and Nursing, Science and Informatics, Engineering and Architecture, Business and Education.
</p>
<h3>Lifelong Learning & Access</h3>
<p>WIT has been a leader in the Irish higher education sector with regard to the provision of lifelong learning opportunities and access for disadvantaged groups. Many of WIT's successful initiatives in this area have been copied by other colleges. Because of the needs of non-standard groups, WIT has responded by developing expertise in the areas of flexible accreditation, outreach and flexible delivery modes.
</p>
<h3>Caring Environment</h3>
<p>
Providing a caring and supportive learning environment for its students is central to WIT's ethos. The range and quality of student support services is excellent. Examples include the Student Life and Learning Centre and the Medical Centre which provide care, counselling, guidance and support for any student encountering personal, social or health difficulties. Good housing for students is also one of WIT's priorities and the Institute currently owns and/or manages sufficient very high quality students apartments to meet the demand.
