#Grid Columns and Rows

As we saw in our previous example, to create a grid structure we require the `ui grid` class. Using a grid makes content appear to flow more naturally on your page.

##Columns
Grids divide horizontal space into indivisible units called **columns**. All columns in a grid must specify their width as proportion of the total 
available row width.

All grid systems choose an arbitrary column count to allow per row. Semantic's default theme uses **16** columns.

The following example creates a grid with 6 columns (3 on the first line and 3 on the next line). The browser detects that the fourth column goes on the next line as 
the grid is a three column grid structure.

<div class="ui container">
<section class="ui three column grid">
<div class="ui column">
             <h2>Frontend</h2>
 	    	<p>
 	    	 ...
 	    	</p>
</div>
<div class="ui  column">
            <h2>Serverside</h2>
 	    	<p>
 	    	 ...
 	    	</p>
</div>
<div class="ui  column">
 	    	<h2>Databases</h2>
 	    	<p>
 	    	 ...
 	    	</p>
</div>
<div class="ui column">
             <h2>Frontend</h2>
 	    	<p>
 	    	 ...
 	    	</p>
</div>
<div class="ui  column">
            <h2>Serverside</h2>
 	    	<p>
 	    	 ...
 	    	</p>
</div>
<div class="ui  column">

 	    	<h2>Databases</h2>
 	    	<p>
 	    	 ...
 	    	</p>
</div>
</section>
</div>

## Rows

In the above example the new line is implicitly a new row. Most grids do not need to specify rows. Content will automatically flow to the next row 
when all the grid columns are taken in the current row.

We can explicitly specify a new row also. Rows are groups of columns which are aligned horizontally.

Rows can either be explicit, marked with an additional row element, or implicit, automatically occurring when no more space is left in a previous row.

<div class="ui container">
<section class="ui three column grid">
<section class="ui row">
<div class="ui column">
             <h2>Frontend</h2>
 	    	<p>
 	    	 ...
 	    	</p>
</div>
<div class="ui  column">
            <h2>Serverside</h2>
 	    	<p>
 	    	 ...
 	    	</p>
</div>
<div class="ui  column">
 	    	<h2>Databases</h2>
 	    	<p>
 	    	 ...
 	    	</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="ui row">
<div class="ui column">
             <h2>Frontend</h2>
 	    	<p>
 	    	 ...
 	    	</p>
</div>
<div class="ui  column">
            <h2>Serverside</h2>
 	    	<p>
 	    	 ...
 	    	</p>
</div>
<div class="ui  column">
 	    	<h2>Databases</h2>
 	    	<p>
 	    	 ...
 	    	</p>
</div>
</section>
</section>
</div>

<a href="archives/Class Htmls/eg4.html" target = "_ blank">Example</a>

As you can see the above 2 examples render the same. Rows are useful however when you wish to explicitly force a new row as in the 
following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/eg4a.html" target = "_ blank">example</a>.

### Divided Grid

A grid can have dividers between its columns. It requires the `ui row` class.

~~~
<div class="ui three column divided grid">
<section class="ui row">
...
</section>
</div>
~~~

<a href="archives/Class Htmls/eg5.html" target = "_ blank">Example</a>

### Vertically Divided Grid

A grid can have dividers between rows. It also requires the `ui row` class.

~~~
<div class="ui three column vertically divided grid">
<section class="ui row">
...
</section>
</div>
~~~

<a href="archives/Class Htmls/eg6.html" target = "_ blank">Example</a>

### Celled Grid

A grid can have rows divided into cells.It also requires the `ui row` class.

~~~
<div class="ui three column celled grid">
<section class="ui row">
...
</section>
</div>
~~~

<a href="archives/Class Htmls/eg7.html" target = "_ blank">Example</a>
