# Getting started with SemanticUI

We will link to the required `Semantic UI` files using CloudFlare, a content delivery network (CDN). Note that there are three links you need to include in each page in your website:

- Link to the SemanticUI CSS file, which should go in the `<head>` section of the page.
- Link to the SemanticUI JavaScript and jQuery files, which should go at the end of your HTML content, before the closing `</body>` tag.
